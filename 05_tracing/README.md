# Tracing in OpenAI SDK

## What is Tracing?

Tracing in the OpenAI SDK means recording everything that happens during an agent's run.

It helps developers:
- Understand what decisions the agent made
- See how messages were processed
- Debug or analyze the behavior of the agent

---

## Why is Tracing Important?

1. It helps you **see inside** the agent's reasoning process.
2. You can **track handoffs**, thoughts, and messages.
3. It allows you to **debug issues** when the agent gives wrong or unexpected answers.
4. It gives visibility into **multi-agent workflows**.

## Simple Real-World Example

Imagine you have a customer support chatbot. A user asks a question. The chatbot thinks itâ€™s a billing issue and hands it off to a billing agent.

With tracing enabled:
- You can review the decision path.
- You can see why the handoff happened.
- You can understand which agent answered and what they said.

This is useful for improving the chatbot's logic or checking what went wrong if a user complains.

## Summary

- Tracing records everything an agent does during its run.
- It is useful for understanding, debugging, and improving agents.
- It shows messages, decisions, handoffs, and more in a clear and trackable way.
