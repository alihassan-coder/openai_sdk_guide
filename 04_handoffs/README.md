# Handoff in OpenAI SDK

## What is Handoff?

**Handoff** in the OpenAI SDK means **transferring control** from an AI agent to:

- A **human** (e.g., customer support)
- An **external system** (e.g., backend API)
- Another **AI agent**

This happens when the current agent cannot or should not complete the task on its own.

---

## Why Use Handoff?

###  Safety  
To prevent the AI from making harmful or unauthorized decisions.

###  Control  
Allows humans or specialized systems to step in when needed.

###  Clarity  
Makes it clear to users when the AI is no longer handling the task.

###  Collaboration  
Enables complex systems where multiple agents work together, each handling specific tasks.

## Real-World Use Cases

| Scenario                                  | Handoff Target      | Reason                                      |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Request to delete user data               | Human/Admin System  | Privacy-sensitive action                    |
| Asking for legal advice                   | Human expert        | Requires professional legal input           |
| Asking to order food                      | Food-ordering agent | Task-specific agent is better suited        |
| Request beyond general knowledge scope    | Domain-specific AI  | Transfer to a more knowledgeable agent      |

## Types of Handoff

1. **To a Human**  
   When a task requires empathy, judgment, or authority.

2. **To a System**  
   For secure actions like payments, data updates, etc.

3. **To Another Agent**  
   If another AI agent is better trained for that domain (e.g., travel booking, medical advice).

---

## Summary

- **Handoff** is about transferring task control.
- It ensures **safe**, **accurate**, and **cooperative** AI behavior.
- Supports multi-agent collaboration.
- Builds user trust and system flexibility.
