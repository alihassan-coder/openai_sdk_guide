# Understanding Context in OpenAI SDK

## What is Context?

Context refers to the additional information that helps an AI model understand and respond appropriately to user requests. In the OpenAI SDK, context is crucial for:

- Providing relevant background information
- Maintaining conversation history
- Setting specific parameters and constraints
- Guiding the AI's responses
- Sharing important data between different parts of your application

## Types of Context

### 1. Local Context
- Information stored and managed within your application
- Examples:
  - User preferences
  - Application settings
  - Local database connections
  - File system paths
  - Environment variables

### 2. Agent/LLM Context
- Information provided to the AI model during interactions
- Examples:
  - Conversation history
  - System prompts
  - User instructions
  - Relevant documents or data
  - API responses
