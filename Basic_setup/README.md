# OpenAI SDK Integration with Google Gemini Model

This project demonstrates how to use the OpenAI SDK with a Google Gemini model to create a basic AI assistant.

## What is an SDK?

An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers use to build software applications. In this project, we use the OpenAI SDK to communicate with a language model provided by Google's Generative Language API.

## Project Overview

This script sets up an AI assistant that accepts user input, sends it to a Google Gemini model, and returns a generated response. The assistant is configured using an environment variable to keep the API key secure.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Google Gemini API key
- `uv` for installing Python packages
